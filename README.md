# multi-xx

Got cron to work. Yay!!!
There must be a bunch of random files just chilling somewhere.
I'll still need to figure out permissions.
Also got TS to work for this project.

Need to make sure cron is actually running.

```bash
sudo service cron start
```

Maybe it cannot push?

Might need to be doing a manual push.
